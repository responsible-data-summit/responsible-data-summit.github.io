            At a time of unprecedented global changes, across our social, political, and technology systems, protecting and promoting our data rights has become all the more vital work.

            In particular, the role of data in solving (without also exacerbating) our major challenges has never been more acute.  And yet, our understanding of data as a key component of large-scale computational networks, and a major driver of economic value, remains incomplete.  Too many stakeholders -- entrepreneurs, technologists, and policymakers alike -- operate under untested assumptions about the economic nature of data.

            This is a different kind of conference -- one intended for those open to considering new questions, seeking novel solutions, and keen to build a future driven by human values and principles --  a responsible data economy.  We invite you to join us, as we take the first steps towards fashioning what can be thought of as a form of <b> digital stewardship </b>.
